# Low Carbon Technology Trade Analysis

This project explores and analyzes global trade data for low-carbon technology products. The goal is to derive insights from historical trends and statistical analysis while demonstrating professional data analysis techniques.

## **Project Highlights**
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw trade data.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis.
- Visualized trends and correlations in trade patterns.
- Applied hypothesis testing to compare trade values over time.

## **Motivation**
The rise of low-carbon technologies plays a critical role in combating climate change. Analyzing trade patterns helps stakeholders make informed decisions about investment and policy-making.

## **Workflow**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Reshaped the dataset for better analysis.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Trends and distribution of trade values over time.
3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Correlation matrix.
   - Hypothesis testing for trade trends.
4. **Visualization:**
   - Trend charts.
   - Heatmaps for correlation insights.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub
